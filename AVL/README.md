The bst.h creates a Binary Search Tree. It supports several operations such as insert and remove but the tree is not always balanced.

The avlbst.h creates an AVL tree. It also supports functions such as insert and remove, and also make sure the tree is always balanced.

The floorplan.cpp finds a way to tile the rectangles, if there is a possible solution.

Please type "make" to compile the floorplan.cpp
